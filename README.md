# WP Latest Post Menu Link

## Description

This plugin adds custom endpoints for latest posts in categories and tags, and a menu item to link to them. You can customize the title of the menu item.

They can also be accessed by adding `/latest` to the end of the category or tag URL.

For example, if you have a category with the URL `https://example.com/category/my-category/`, you can access the latest posts in that category by going to `https://example.com/category/my-category/latest/`.
